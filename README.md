### How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of this repository on GitHub.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on GitHub is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on from `master` branch.
- Implement/fix your feature.
- Follow the code style of the project, format your code with Prettier.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on GitHub, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Set `master` branch as target.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).
